# RGB-LED-Controller
A PIC12F based high power RGB LED controller inspired from picprojects.org "Mood Light #101".
This version instead uses high power mosfets to control external LED's. Tested up to 3 Amps,
but can theoretically handle up to 5 Amps.
Firmware and schematic based from http://picprojects.org.uk/projects/rgb/index.htm
